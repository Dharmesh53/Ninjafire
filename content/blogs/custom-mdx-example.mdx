export default function HelloWorld() {
  return (

## Images

This uses [Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) in MDX for seamless image rendering:

```
<Image
  src="/opengraph-image.png"
  alt="OpenGraph image"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>
```

<Image
  src="/opengraph-image.png"
  alt="OpenGraph image"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

This uses [react-wrap-balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app/) to evenly balance captions in MDX posts.

```
<Caption>
  Captions that flow smoothly, making your content easy to read and visually
  appealing with a clean look.
</Caption>
```
